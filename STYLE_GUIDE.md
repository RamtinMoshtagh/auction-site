## HTML Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements.
- Ensure accessibility by using ARIA roles and attributes where appropriate.

## CSS/SCSS Conventions
- Use BEM notation for class names.
- Nest SCSS sparingly to avoid overly specific selectors.

## JavaScript Standards
- Use camelCase for variable names and function names.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.

## Commit Message Format
- Begin the message with a verb in the imperative mood.
- Summarize changes in the past tense.
- Reference issues when applicable.

## Branch Naming Conventions
- Use short, descriptive names.
- Use hyphens to separate words.
- Prefix feature branches with `feature/`, bugfix branches with `bugfix/`, and hotfix branches with 
`hotfix/`.

## Pull Request Process
- Provide a summary of changes.
- Link to the issue being addressed.
- Request reviews from specific team members.
